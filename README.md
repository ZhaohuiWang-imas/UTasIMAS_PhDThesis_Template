# UTasIMAD_PhDThesis_Template
A Latex template for a PhD thesis at the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania.

This template is a slightly modified version provided by

https://github.com/mdsumner/utas_latex_thesis

Please, check the link for help setting up the template.

Change I performed are
- adaptation for IMAS requirements
- adding an acronym file
- adding a layout for a co-authorship page
- changes to the layout / adding an empty page after the title page

Quick overview on the template:

The three files thesis_ex.tex, imasphdthesis.sty, and prelude.tex are important for the overall layout.

thesis_ex.tex
- main file in which you specifiy which files to include

imasphdthesis.sty
- to change the layout of the thesis (e.g. margins)

prelude.tex
- add information for title page
- add abstract text
- add acknowledgements
- add info on co-autorship (if applicable)

The actual thesis text is to be written in the chapter files (chap1.tex, etc).

Happy writing!
